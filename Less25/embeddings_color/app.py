    You might have heard that objects like words or images can be represented by "vectors". 
    What does that mean, exactly? It seems like a tricky concept, but it doesn't have to be.
     
    Let's start here, where colors are represented in 3-D space ðŸŒˆ.
    Each axis represents how much of primary colors `(red, green, and blue)`
    each color comprises.
     
    For example, `Magenta` is represented by `(255, 0, 255)`,
    and `(80, 200, 120)` represents `Emerald`.
    That's all a *vector* is in this context - a sequence of numbers.

    Take a look at the resulting 3-D image below; it's kind of mesmerising!

    You see here that similar colors are placed close to each other in space.
     
    It seems obvious, but **this** is the crux of why a *vector representation* is so powerful. 
    These objects being located *in space* based on their key property (`color`) 
    enables an easy, objective assessment of similarity.

    Imagine that you need to identify colors similar to a given color. 
    You could do it by name, for instance looking for colors containing matching words.
    
    But remember that in the 3-D chart above, similar colors are physically close to each other. 
    So all you actually need to do is to calculate distances, and collect points based on a threshold!
    
    That's probably still a bit abstract - so pick a 'base' color, and we'll go from there. 
    In fact - try a few different colors while you're at it!

    ### Generally speaking...
    
    Obviously, this is a pretty simple, self-contained example. 
    Colors are particularly suited for representing using just a few
    numbers, like our primary colors. One number represents how much
    `red` each color contains, another for `green`, and the last for `blue`.
    
    But that core concept of representing similarity along different
    properties using numbers is exactly what happens in other domains.
    
    The only differences are in *how many* numbers are used, and what
    they represent. For example, words or documents might be represented by 
    hundreds (e.g. 300 or 768) of AI-derived numbers.
